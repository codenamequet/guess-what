        <p>In this game you will be given a random country in the continent of Africa that you are to guess. The underscores on the game board will represent the number of letters in that country. When you guess the correct letter it will appear on the board replacing the underscore. When you guess incorrectly the face of the emoji will gradually change as he anxiously approaches losing his cool. Wins and losses will be tallied as you play, enjoy.</p>
